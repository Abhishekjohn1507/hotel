# Fixing Vercel Deployment 404 NOT_FOUND Issues

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to fix the 404 NOT_FOUND error you're experiencing with your Vercel deployment.

## Understanding the Issue

Based on the error screenshots, your Vercel deployment is failing with a 404 NOT_FOUND error. This is happening because:

1. The build output structure doesn't match the routing configuration in `vercel.json`
2. The server file path in the routes configuration is incorrect
3. The static assets are not being properly served

## Solution Steps

### 1. Update vercel.json

Replace your current `vercel.json` with the following configuration:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/node"
    },
    {
      "src": "dist/public/**",
      "use": "@vercel/static"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/api/(.*)",
      "dest": "/dist/index.js"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/dist/public/$1"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/dist/public/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Redeploy to Vercel

After updating the `vercel.json` file, redeploy your application:

```bash
vercel --prod
```

Or push the changes to your repository if you have Git integration enabled.

### 3. Verify the Deployment

Once the deployment is complete, visit your Vercel URL to verify that the application is working correctly.

## Key Changes Explained

1. **Entry Point**: Changed from `server/index.ts` to `package.json` to use the project's build script
2. **Build Command**: Added explicit `buildCommand` to run `npm run build`
3. **Output Directory**: Specified `dist` as the output directory
4. **API Routes**: Updated to point to the compiled server file at `/dist/index.js`
5. **Static Assets**: Added a route to serve static assets from `/dist/public/$1`
6. **Client Routing**: Maintained the fallback route for client-side routing

## Expected Build Output Structure

After a successful build, your project structure should look like this:

```
dist/
├── index.js        # Compiled server code
└── public/         # Static assets
    ├── assets/     # JS, CSS, and other assets
    └── index.html  # Main HTML file
```

## Troubleshooting

- If you still encounter issues, check the Vercel deployment logs for specific error messages
- Verify that your build script in `package.json` is correctly configured
- Ensure that your project's dependencies are properly installed

## Note on Vercel Warnings

You may see a warning about "unused build settings" in your Vercel deployment logs. This is expected and can be safely ignored, as we're using a custom build configuration.
